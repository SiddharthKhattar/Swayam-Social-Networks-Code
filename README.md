# Swayam-Social-Networks-Code 
This repository contains all the code that is used in the SWAYAM course for Introduction to Social Networks. 
Anyone can fork this repository if they want to access the code for themselves and play around with the data.
Please note that this repository is not official and was created by a student as the exact code in the SWAYAM course was outdated due to later versions of python, matplotlib and the networkx module removing support for functions that were critical for running the code.
